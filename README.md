## Project Overview

This repository contains an E-commerce Product Recommendation project that utilizes recommendation techniques to recommend shoes products from the "Amazon UK shoes product reviews dataset". Recommendation systems are essential tools in today's digital landscape, guiding users to personalized content and products. This project explores and implements various recommendation approaches to enhance user experiences in e-commerce, including content-based filtering, memory-based collaborative filtering, and model-based collaborative filtering.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Amazon UK shoes product reviews dataset". It contains a collection of customer reviews and ratings for shoes products available on Amazon UK. The dataset provides valuable insights into customers' preferences and opinions about different shoes products.

### Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering recommends products based on their textual attributes, such as product names, descriptions, and user reviews. It offers personalized recommendations by matching the content of products with a user's preferences.

### Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering

Memory-based collaborative filtering checks user-user similarity and recommends items based on the preferences or behaviors of similar users. It provides user-centric suggestions using similarity metrics like Pearson correlation and cosine similarity.

### Model-Based Collaborative Filtering

Model-based collaborative filtering employs matrix factorization techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to identify latent patterns in user-item interactions. It offers highly personalized product recommendations based on correlations between items.
